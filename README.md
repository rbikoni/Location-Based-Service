# Location-Based-Service
Location Based Service using smartphones RSSID to determine the location on a pre-generated map of collected fingerprint locations. This project contains a module for the LBS(Location Based Service) Server(java), to calculate and display the position of a client. A LBS Scanner(smartphone) to create a fingerprint map of positions by their RSS of accesspoints. A LBS client(smartphone) which is collecting the RSS of the surrounding accesspoint and send it to the LBS Server to determine its position. The Scanner and LBS Client have been tested with an HTC Desire Android 2.2. The source code needs to be changed (ip, port, database) if it should work your side. BUG:The generated XML of the LBS Scanner needs to be modified manually, root tag is missing.
